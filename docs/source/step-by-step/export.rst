The "Export data set figure" section enables users to save visual representations of their selected data sets and orthogonality metrics. Users can:

- Specify the export directory and an optional folder name for organization.
- Choose a figure type and select from a list of available figures.
- Save the currently selected figure(s) from the list, including:
    - The selected data set from the list.
    - The selected orthogonality metric plot.

This feature ensures that important plots from the analysis can be easily saved for reporting or further review.

.. note::
   For each saved plot, the figure will be displayed in the visualization area. This allows users to immediately view and confirm the exported plot.

The "Export table(s)" section allows users to export key tables generated throughout the analysis. Users can:

- Select one or more tables from the following list to export:
    - Normalized retention table
    - 2D Combination table
    - OM result table
    - Orthogonality result correlation table
    - Final result and ranking table
- Choose the export directory and specify the file name (e.g., `export_table.xlsx`).
- Export the selected tables in a single operation.

This flexible export functionality ensures that all relevant results and intermediate data can be easily saved and shared for further analysis or documentation.
