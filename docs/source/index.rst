About
=====
Welcome to the documentation for **2DComboSelector**! This Python-based tool simplifies comprehensive
two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC × LC) method development by automating orthogonality evaluation and peak capacity prediction.
It integrates multiple widely used orthogonality metrics to calculate an overall score,
enabling users to systematically screen and compare 2D combinations and visualize peak distributions within a user-friendly environment.
By streamlining these processes, the tool reduces bias, minimizes manual effort, and supports the selection of optimal LC × LC conditions for reliable analysis of complex samples.

- ✅ Import and normalize your 1D-LC retention time data
- ✅ Automatically generate all possible 2D combinations from your datasets
- ✅ Calculate multiple orthogonality metrics and an overall orthogonality score
- ✅ Predict practical 2D peak capacities
- ✅ Visualize and compare 2D separation predictions
- ✅ Filter and rank combinations based on practical constraints
- ✅ Select optimal conditions for experimental validation

This documentation will guide you through installation, running your first analysis, and understanding the step-by-step workflow to get the most out of the tool.*
